Welcome to the UCI Class Notifier - Programmed by Vincent Hoang

Having the right classes can be the difference between graduating on time and staying another year, but when all the classes that you want are full, not all hope is lost.
The UCI Class Notifier program lets students know when their once previously full class has an opening, enabling students to take this brief window of opportunity and immediately enroll.

How to use:

Users will be first greeted by the main menu.
In the main menu, you are given several options:
1 - Add a course
2 - Delete a course
3 - View your courses
4 - Enter waiting mode
Q - Quit the program

The first three and last options are self-explanatory, but what about the 4th option?
The 4th option is waiting mode. Sit back, relax, and enter the waiting mode as it will begin checking the availability of your classes EVERY minute.

There are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes within 1 hour; that's 1,440 checks on your classes PER day.

In the future, I look forward to "upgrading" this program to send notifications to one's phone, preferably. I have tried looking to integrate this, but it comes at an expense;
an expense that I have to pay out of pocket, and due to my current circumstances, it just isn't feasible. But I digress, and hopefully, this program will positively impact your life just as it has with mine.
